This week our group made ec2 instances on AWS. Allan found this tool to generate work load on to our system for 
testing. We made an ec2 instance then connected to the instance and installed stress using the comand sudo apt-get 
install stress, we used ubuntu. To run it you start off with sudo stress option argument. The command uptime is used 
to check on the load average. We also used some code in our ec2 instances, 
Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-04bc3da8f14823e88, we used this code in user data, 
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd24 php72 mysql57-server php72-mysqlnd
sudo service httpd start
sudo chkconfig httpd on
sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
it created an apache page and a php page for the instance using the dns. So we just tested different loads on 
instances. I also made some ec2 instances with the desired requirements made the key pairs, configured the windows 
instance. Conneted to the instance using the console and assigned a fixed ip address. 
 for the lab. I also started playiing around with s3 buckets to practice. I
used one last semester and was interested in learning more.
