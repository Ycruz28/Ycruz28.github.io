So this week we worked on a workshop! Creating a ec2 spot fleet. 


So first thing first, make sure you are using a AWS account that has admistrator access. 
*AWS Managment Console Access
*Uncheck reset, then click next.
*Now we move onto the tab Attach existing policies directly.
**Chose Administrator Access, then click next.


Next is setting up the architecture
*Creating a cloudformation stack with the following: (code provided) 
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ec2-spot-fleet-web-app --template-body file://ec2-spot-fleet-web-app.
yaml --capabilities CAPABILIITY_IAM --region us-east-1 
*You should then recieve a stack value if done correctly.
*Next Application Load Balancer, under EC2 service select load balancers.
*Click create one, leave all as default. In availability zone chose the one creeated by your cloudformation stack. 
*Next select both security groups. In Configure Routing section, give your target group a name and leave everything 
as default. 
*Move onto review and select create, then close. 

Next is setting up the fleet. Under the ec2 service locate spot request, select request spot instance. 
Leave everything as default, under the network section select the VPC created by your cloudformation stack. Chose 
the availability zone and subnets used when creating your application load balancer. The rest stays as default. On
user data enter the following: (code provided)
** #!/bin/bash
yum -y update
yum -y install httpd
chkconfig httpd on
instanceid=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
echo "hello from $instanceid" > /var/www/html/index.html
service httpd start
**
For your instance tag, key=loadBalancerTargetGroup value= target group ARN. 
Total Capacity =2 Optional on demand= 0. Then click on Mantain taret capacity, under fleet request settings uncheck 
Apply Recommendations. Under additional request details uncheck Apply defaults. Under load balancing check recieve 
traffic from one or more load balancers. Click launch. 

This is as far as we got so far. We plan to continue next week...... Thank You!
